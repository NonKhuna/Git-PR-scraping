Closes #41388
I was following the course and I was surprised by the \b escape sequence being called ""word boundary"". It appears to have been an accidental change while changing the name of \b in regex (more info in #41388), but it is not correct in the context of string escape sequences.
For reference, consult the MDN:

Closes #49976
In this PR, I've revised the introduction text for the ""Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements"" curriculum lesson. The changes include incorporating the suggestion from a FreeCodeCamp member to use a switch statement when matching one value against many options, and providing a more concise and clear explanation of the switch statement syntax and behavior. These changes will improve the learning experience for FreeCodeCamp students by providing more accurate and effective guidance on how to use switch statements in JavaScript.","['Update caseInSwitch function with switch statement', 'Update introduction text']",['Possible Change to Switch Introduction']
